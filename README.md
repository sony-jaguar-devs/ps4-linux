Linux Kernel - On the Sony PlayStation 4
========================================

This is a Linux Kernel source tailored to run on exploitable PlayStation 4 systems with various subsystem patches from the [fail0verflow team](https://github.com/fail0verflow/ps4-linux), [eeply](https://github.com/eeply/ps4-linux), [Ps3itaTeam](https://github.com/Ps3itaTeam/ps4-linux), [mircoho](https://github.com/ps4gentoo/ps4-linux-5.3.7), [codedwrench](https://github.com/codedwrench/ps4-linux/), [crashniels](https://github.com/crashniels/linux/) and others.

This fork aims to make the internal WiFi+Bluetooth modules on specific PlayStation models with the Marvell    
88w8897 combo card (internal codename Torus 2) functional, as they typically error out on the default kernels.

The console models that are known to have the Torus 2 module, and their testing results from this patched kernel are:
``` 
CUH-1216(A/B) { WiFi: Functional | Bluetooth: Functional }    
CUH-1215(A/B) { WiFi: Functional | Bluetooth: Functional }    
[A and B are just hard-drive specification: 500 GB vs 1000GB].   
```

The primary patches which in combination fix the module are:     
[150 MHz rate limit quirk on the 88w8897 card's Function 0](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/df7f7dbb1b0fff6026e159540f029988c8067b70)

relying on the [patch for added sdio_id for the Function 0](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/f4835fb020010acff2b70e4c5fa9430e07f0073b)

Then a [few SDHCI Host quirks for the PlayStation SDHCI host; a couple of which might be unnecessary \(haven't tested the redundancy yet\)](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/e6f342df7737722d5e27f0ae3974e493c5fe4ca4)

additionally with [extra retries for MMC CMD 52 or 53, which it would usually fail on.](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/c57162e5ec7a4aa3af3310a36dc963b5c0298dfe)

The primary culprit behind the failed SDIO initialization, seems to be that the card doesn't properly support 208 or 200 MHz clock rate on this PS4 SDHCI host, causing the card to show tuning and other command failures.    
Through much trial and error, I was able to reach such an arcane fix,

Hard work paid off!

There are different branches that you can select on the repo,    
`ps4-linux-5.15.y` and `ps4-linux-5.15.y-conservative2` are branches with excessive debug logs, that helped me pinpoint the issue on the whole MMC stack. Due to the logging, it is not advisable to use those kernel branches.

The primary release branches are:    
`ps4-linux-5.15.y-fix-clean` : The clean WiFi fix branch for Kernel version 5.15.15    
`ps4-linux-5.15.189-fix-clean` : The clean WiFi fix branch for Kernel version 5.15.189 (Still broken, causes white LED on the PS4 during boot)    
`ps4-linux-6.15.y-crashniels`: The clean WiFi fix branch for Kernel version 6.15.4.

To compile them, you can simply fork the repo, go to the Actions tab and run the Workflow file for `build-kernel_latest.yaml` for a particular branch.

Or if you would like to build locally, just clone the repo for your desired branch and run:
```bash
mv config .config

export MAKE_OPTS="-j`nproc` \
              HOSTCC=gcc-11 \
              CC=gcc-11"
# gcc-11 is ideal for compiling the 5.15.y kernels, otherwise you will have many typecheck and compile errors 
make ${MAKE_OPTS} olddefconfig
make ${MAKE_OPTS} prepare
echo "making kernel. . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS}
echo "making modules . . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS} modules
echo "installing kernel . . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS} install
echo "installing modules . . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS} modules_install
```

To get some pre-compiled kernels, go to the [releases section](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/releases), and choose a kernel (bzImage) based on your needed version.

If something doesn't work, or your model still has unsupported WiFi, you can open a GitHub issue to share the concerns.

Happy 802.11-ing ! 😃️

======== Generic Linux Kernel Doucmentation: ========


There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
