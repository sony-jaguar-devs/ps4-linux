This fork aimed to make the internal WiFi+Bluetooth modules on specific PlayStation models with the Marvell 88w8897 combo card (internal codename Torus 2) functional, as they typically error out on the default kernels.

Over time, I also managed to fix the common blackscreen at GUI login issue on newer kernels, and added support for various miscellaneous components such as the MT7668 WiFi and BT chip on certain consoles.  
The branch names are meant to be descriptive and provide an idea, but they're far from perfect!

Merging all the main fixes into a few distinct branches is a WIP.

-------
## Console Models and Southbridge

While the CUH-1216/1215 models are definitively known to have the Torus 2 models with probelmatic WiFi, along with some 11xx models with similar WiFi issues, here is a list of consoles reported working without any hiccups from the kernels in this repo:

| Console Model | Variation | WiFi+BT Chip Present | Compatible Kernel (Patched) |
|---|---|---| --- |
| CUH-1216(A/B) | Phat - Belize B0 | Marvell 88w8897 (Torus 2) | *6.15.4, 5.15.15* |
| CUH-1215(A/B) | Phat - Belize | Marvell 88w8897 (Torus 2) | *6.15.4, 5.15.15*  |
CUH-1003  | Phat  - Aeolia | ? | *6.15.4; [probably non-built in firmware version](#builtin-fw-anchor)* |
CUH-1004A | Phat - Aeolia | Marvell 88w8797 (Torus 1) | *6.15.4; [non-built in firmware version](#builtin-fw-anchor)* |
CUH-1116A | Phat - Aeolia | ? | *6.15.4* |
CUH-2215B | Slim - Baikal | ? | *5.4.247* |
CUH-2216A | Slim - Baikal B1 | MediaTek 7668 | *5.4.247* |
CUH-2216A | Slim - Belize | MediaTek 7668 | *5.15.15* |
CUH-7116B | Pro - Baikal B1 | ? | *5.4.247* |
CUH-7202B | Pro - Baikal | ? | *5.4.247* |

```
[A and B are just hard-drive specification: 500 GB vs 1000GB].

Aeolia, Belize and Baikal are the console Southbridges.
B0, B1 etc. are the Southbridge subrevisions.
```
<a name="builtin-fw-anchor"></a>
[ Certain older models (specifically the 1004A) needed a kernel that
was built without embedding the latest proprietary firmware blobs (for
WiFi+Bluetooth), and instead functioned properly with older firmware
sourced from the initramfs. For these, each affected kernel release has a "no-built-in-fw"
version for best functionality. See the releases page of the referring kernels for more
information.]

- TODO: Add a list with all supported console models, their southbridges, and their compatible kernels.

## Fixing the Wireless Card on CUH-1216

The main patches which in combination fix the CUH-1216/1215 wireless module are:     
[150 MHz rate limit quirk on the 88w8897 card's Function 0](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/df7f7dbb1b0fff6026e159540f029988c8067b70).

relying on the [patch for added sdio_id for the Function 0](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/f4835fb020010acff2b70e4c5fa9430e07f0073b),

Then a [few SDHCI Host quirks for the PlayStation SDHCI host](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/e6f342df7737722d5e27f0ae3974e493c5fe4ca4) {only the SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN is needed now},

additionally with [extra retries for MMC CMD 52 or 53, which it would usually fail on](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/commit/c57162e5ec7a4aa3af3310a36dc963b5c0298dfe) {this is optional}.

The primary culprit behind the failed SDIO initialization, seems to be that the card doesn't properly support 208 or 200 MHz clock rate on this PS4 SDHCI host, causing the card to show tuning and other command failures.
You can read more about the search for a solution [from here](https://ps4linux.com/forums/d/221-ps4-phat-wifi-fix-test-marvell-8897-torus-20/14).    

Through MUCH trial and error, I was able to reach such an arcane fix,

and here's a screenshot with working internal WiFi and Bluetooth as shown in the logs, on an Arch Linux system running on my CUH-1216 console:

Hard work paid off!

## Branches

There are different branches that you can select on the repo,    
`x_old__ps4-linux-5.15.y` and `x_old__ps4-linux-5.15.y-conservative2` are branches with excessive debug logs, that helped me pinpoint the issue on the whole MMC stack. Due to the logging, it is not advisable to use those kernel branches.    

The other "x_experimental__" or "x_exp__" prefixed branches were made for debugging & testing a particular subsystem or problem in the kernel, and are not advised to be used.  
They are only kept for further future experiment, archive or study only.  

\- \- For example, the `x_experimental__5.15.15-fix-baikal` branch is non-functional.
Kernel 5.15 is not reported to be working on any Baikal console, but it's kept for testing only.

\
The `5.15.15-aeolia-belize` is a branch without the PS4 patches from codedwrench's **Baikal** branch.    
It still runs as intended on a Belize (no blackscreen fix yet), but you will get bad errors. Should be used for testing only.

However, it probably runs on Aeolia models, unlike the \*-belize -only branches. (Not tested yet)

----

The main release branches are:    
- `5.15.15-belize` : The clean WiFi, Blackscreen & other misc. fixes' branch for Kernel version 5.15.15 on Belize southbridges.  
This is the primary branch of the repo.   

- `5.15.189-belize` : The clean WiFi & Blackscreen fix branch for Kernel version 5.15.189 on Belize southbridges.  
(Not as well maintained as 5.15.15)

- `5.4.247-baikal-dfaus`: A branch for version 5.4.247 with fixed blackscreen and MT7668 support for Baikal southbridges.    
Based on DFAUS' source.

- `6.15.4-aeolia-belize-crashniels` : The clean WiFi, Blackscreen & other misc. fixes' branch for Kernel version 6.15.4, on Aeolia/Belize southbridges.    
Based on crashniels' source.

## Compile and Build

To compile any of these branches, you can simply fork the repo, go to the Actions tab and run the Workflow file for `build-kernel_latest.yaml` for a particular branch.

Or if you would like to build locally, just clone the repo for your desired branch and run the necessary commands:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx --branch <desired-branch-name> --depth=3
#keep a low depth to save on space

cd ps4-linux-12xx
echo "Copying necessary extra firmware to /lib/firmware"
sudo cp -ri extra_firmware/* /lib/firmware

sudo mkdir /lib/firmware/mrvl
wget -nc https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/plain/mrvl/sd8897_uapsta.bin \
&& sudo mv -i sd8897_uapsta.bin /lib/firmware/mrvl

wget -nc https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/plain/mrvl/sd8797_uapsta.bin \
&& sudo mv -i sd8797_uapsta.bin /lib/firmware/mrvl


sudo mkdir /lib/firmware/mediatek
wget -nc https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/plain/mediatek/mt7668pr2h.bin \
&& sudo mv -i mt7668pr2h.bin /lib/firmware/mediatek


## Rename .config file

mv config .config

export MAKE_OPTS="-j`nproc` \
              HOSTCC=gcc-11 \
              CC=gcc-11"
# gcc-11 is ideal for compiling the 5.4 & 5.15.y kernels, and can build 6.15.y too
# Otherwise you will have many typecheck and compile errors compiling the older kernels
make ${MAKE_OPTS} olddefconfig
make ${MAKE_OPTS} prepare
echo "making kernel. . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS}
echo "making modules . . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS} modules
echo "installing kernel . . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS} install
echo "installing modules . . ."
make ${MAKE_OPTS} modules_install
```

## Releases and Downloads

To get some pre-compiled kernels, go to the [releases section](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx/releases), and choose a kernel (bzImage) based on your needed version.

Please read the boldened out and highlighted text, as they contain some information that might be useful for a particular release. It's very wordy, that needs to be fixed!!

<br>

---
## Contributing

If something doesn't work on these kernels, has missing features, or your model still has unsupported WiFi, you can open a GitHub issue to share its details.

Pull requests/code contributions are always welcome.

## Documentation, Guides and the PS4 Linux Future (As of December 2025)

While many of the bugs and issues prevalent in PS4 Linux kernels, and PS4 Linux in general have been fixed over the years, many of them still exist, and are seldom worked on.  
A few honorable mentions aimed at improving this scene go to:

1. Blackscreen/No Display/Unsupported Monitor issue:
    - https://github.com/oberdfr/kernel-ps4linux/tree/ps4-linux-v6.17.1-custom-resolution:  
attempts at using the display EDID information from your monitor, to use in Linux. This aims to improve the various blackscreen issues for monitors that don't support 1080p, or when using a capture card.  
(Work in Progress)

    - https://github.com/ps4gentoo/initramfs &  
    https://github.com/ps4boot/ps4-linux-payloads/  
    Same goal as the last link, but attempts it (successfully) by acquiring the EDID from Orbis (PS4-OS) throught the PS4-Linux Loader, and copies it over to the initramfs.  
    (Work in Progress; latest fix might not've been committed)

Generic Linux Kernel Documentation
------

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
